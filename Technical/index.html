                A heart attack refers to the necrosis (death) of heart tissue as a result of a loss of oxygenated blood. The sooner the signs and symptoms are recognized and treated, the better the victim's chance of survival. <br> 
                Even victims who have had a heart attack may not recognize the signs because each heart attack may have different signs and symptoms. <br>
                Summon EMS personnel and provide prompt care if the victim shows or reports any of the signs and symptoms listed below. Ask open-ended questions, such as, "How are you feeling?" to hear the symptoms<br>described in the victim's own words.

            <h2>Cardiac Arrest</h2>
            <section>
                Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening emergency that may be caused by a heart attack, drowning, electrocution, respiratory arrest or other conditions. <br>  
                Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or beats too irregularly or weakly to circulate blood effectively. 
                Cardiac arrest can occur suddenly and without warning. In many cases, the victim has already been experiencing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack.
                However, sudden cardiac arrest is often the first sign of sudden death.

            </h2>
            <p>
                A victim who is unresponsive, not breathing normally and has no pulse is in cardiac arrest and needs CPR (Figure 3-3). 
                The objective of CPR is to perform a combination of effective chest compressions and ventilations to circulate blood 
                that contains oxygen to the victim's brain and other vital organs. In most cases, CPR is performed in cycles of 30 
                chest compressions followed by 2 ventilations.
            </p>
            <p>Summoning EMS personnel immediately is critical for the victim's survival. 
                If an AED is available, it should be used in combination with CPR and according to local protocols until EMS personnel take over.
                
            </p>
           
            <p>
                One component of CPR is chest compressions. 
                To ensure optimal victim outcomes, high-quality CPR must be performed. You can ensure high-quality CPR by providing high-quality chest compressions, making sure that the:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Victim is on a firm, flat surface to allow for adequate compression, such as the floor or ground.</li><br>
                <li>Chest is exposed to ensure proper hand placement and the ability to visualize chest recoil.</li><br>
                <li>Hands are correctly positioned with the heel of one hand in the center of the chest on the lower half of the victim's sternum, with the other hand on top. Most responders find that interlacing their fingers makes it easier to provide compressions while keeping the fingers off the chest.</li><br>
                <li>Arms are as straight as possible, with the shoulders directly over the hands to promote effective compressions. Locking elbows will help maintain straight arms. </li><br>
                <li>Compressions are given at the correct rate-at least 100 per minute to a maximum of 120 per minute-and at the proper depth to ensure adequate circulation:</li><br>
                <li>For an adult, compress the chest at least 2 inches, but no more than 2.4 inches. <br>
                    For a child, compress the chest about 2 inches. <br>
                    For an infant, compress the chest about 11/2 inches. <br>
                    </li>
                <li>Chest must be allowed to fully recoil between each compression to allow blood to flow back into the heart following the compression. Interruptions to chest compressions are minimized.</li><br>

                An automated external defibrillator (AED)is a portable electronic devices that analyzes the heart's rhythm and provides an electrical shock. 
                Defibrillation is the delivery of an electrical shock that may help re-establish an effective rhythm. CPR can help by supplying blood that contains oxygen <br> 
                to the brain and other vital organs. However, the sooner an AED is used, the greater the likelihood of survival. <br>
                You must assess victims quickly and be prepared to use an AED in cases of cardiac arrest.

            <h3>When the Heart Stops</h3>
            <section>
                Any damage to the heart from disease or injury can disrupt the heart's electrical system, which normally triggers the contraction-or pumping <br>
                action-of the heart muscle. This disruption can result in an abnormal heart rhythm, possibly stopping circulation. Two common treatable <br>
                abnormal rhythms that cause sudden cardiac arrest are ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). <br><br>
                In VF, the ventricles quiver, or fibrillate, without any organized rhythm, and the electrical impulses fire at random, creating chaos and <br>
                preventing the heart from pumping and circulating blood. There is no normal breathing and no pulse. In pulseless VT, an abnormal electrical <br>
                impulse controls the heart. This abnormal impulse fires so fast that the heart's chambers do not have time to fill, and the heart is unable <br>
                to pump blood effectively. As with V-fib, there is no normal breathing or pulse with pulseless VT. <br><br>
                In many cases, VF and VT can be corrected by early defibrillation. If VF or VT is not corrected, all electrical activity will eventually cease, <br>
                 a condition called. asystole. Asystole cannot be corrected by defibrillation. You cannot tell what, if any, rhythm the heart has by feeling <br>
                 for a pulse. An AED will analyze the heart's rhythm and advise if shock should be applied.
